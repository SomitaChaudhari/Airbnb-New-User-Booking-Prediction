# Airbnb New User Booking Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict the destination country for new Airbnb users based on historical sign-up and user behavior data. By leveraging advanced data wrangling techniques, feature engineering, and machine learning models (including gradient boosting and deep learning), the solution provides actionable insights into user preferences. These predictions help guide marketing strategies and improve user engagement by tailoring offerings based on predicted travel behavior.

## Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project (sourced from the Airbnb New User Bookings competition) contains detailed information about new user sign-ups. Key characteristics include:
- **User Demographics & Account Information:**  
  - Date of account creation and first activity  
  - Age, gender, and language settings  
  - Sign-up method and flow
- **Referral & Device Details:**  
  - Affiliate channel, provider, and first device type  
  - Browser information and sign-up app used
- **Target Variable:**  
  - *country_destination*: The first country in which a new user makes a booking (including a class for users who do not book).
  
The dataset comprises thousands of records, providing a rich and diverse basis for modeling new user behavior.

## Methodology

### Data Wrangling & Preprocessing
- **Data Cleaning:**  
  Handled missing values, corrected data types, and addressed outliers using exploratory tools like `missingno`.
- **Feature Engineering:**  
  - Extracted temporal features from date fields (e.g., month, day, hour).  
  - Encoded categorical variables using techniques from `pandas` and `sklearn`.
  - Derived new features based on user behavior patterns.
- **Data Splitting:**  
  Divided the dataset into training and testing subsets for model validation.

### Model Building & Evaluation
- **Models Explored:**  
  - **XGBoost:** Leveraged for its ability to handle structured data and capture non-linear relationships.
  - **Neural Networks:** Built using Keras and TensorFlow to explore deep learning approaches.
  - **Traditional Machine Learning Models:** Implemented with `sklearn` to provide baseline comparisons.
- **Evaluation Metrics:**  
  Models were assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC. Cross-validation techniques ensured robust performance evaluation.
- **Predictions:**  
  Final predictions were saved in NumPy binary format for both full and fresh datasets.

## Technical Findings
- **Feature Importance:**  
  Advanced feature engineering was crucial—key predictors included user demographics, sign-up method, and device/browser details.
- **Model Performance:**  
  - XGBoost delivered competitive performance by capturing complex interactions among features.
  - Deep learning models (using Keras/TensorFlow) provided additional improvements in capturing non-linearities but required careful tuning.
  - Ensemble approaches helped boost overall prediction accuracy.
- **Processing Efficiency:**  
  Data wrangling and model training pipelines were optimized for scalability, ensuring that the models can be retrained and updated as new data becomes available.

## Business Insights & Findings
- **Targeted Marketing & Personalization:**  
  By predicting the most likely booking destination, Airbnb can tailor marketing campaigns and offers to specific user segments, thereby improving conversion rates.
- **Resource Allocation:**  
  Insights from user behavior allow for more efficient allocation of resources (e.g., customer support, localized advertising), ultimately enhancing user experience.
- **User Retention:**  
  Understanding early user preferences helps in designing engagement strategies that foster long-term loyalty and satisfaction.
- **Strategic Decision-Making:**  
  The model’s predictions provide Airbnb with a data-driven basis for refining product offerings and exploring new market opportunities.
